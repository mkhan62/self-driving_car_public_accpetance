# Understanding Acceptance of Self-Driving Cars Using New York Times 2013-2018
### Research has found that public acceptance is a determining factor for the success of self-driving cars as an emerging technology.
###### Thereâ€™s a great deal of uncertainty for the success of emerging technologies, and public perception of the technology can be a determining factor. The idea of self-driven cars has been fantasized over the last three decades, however it is over the last five years that major steps have taken in the development and implementation of the technology. This research is to observe the evolution of the perception of self-driving cars since 2013 and develop certain metrics to understand the trending reaction of public about the technology. This paper identifies crucial issues about public trust on self-driving cars and provides essential management concerns to help increase acceptance of autonomous cars. It also provides a machine learning model to help predict public response to the technology in the future to understand certain steps to be taken at present for positive development. Additionally, it indicates the changes in popularity of self-driving cars over the last five years and highlights major shifts in perception about self-driving cars among people.
